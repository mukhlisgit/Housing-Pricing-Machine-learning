# Housing-Pricing-Machine-learning
Housing Pricing - Machine Learning Project
Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest to both buyers and sellers. In this project, housing prices will be estimated by taking into account the explanatory variables covering many aspects of housing. The goal of this project is to create a regression model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on features.
Data collecting:
The aim of the project is to apply data visualization techniques to gain insight into data. Machine learning is often required to understand data and its insights. This project aims to apply various Python tools to visually understand the data and clean it up to make it ready to apply machine learning models on the data.
Problem definition:
Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest to both buyers and sellers.
With 79 explanatory variables that describe (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this dataset will help you predict the final price of each home.
Real World / Business Goals and Constraints:
Goals:
1. Estimate the selling price of each house.
2. Minimize the difference between projected and actual rating (RMSE / MSE)
3. Scale the reliability of your model with different metrics of performance (accuracy etc.)
